											<p>Hi there! My name is Sreehari, and this is my second year as a web development intern for BAYCO. I joined BAYCO because of the tangible impact I could have on thousands of students across the FUHSD district. I was amazed at the impact we had last year with respect to the workshops we held, and the amount of highschoolers we were able to find jobs for. In my spare time I enjoy playing with my 2 dogs, creating AI powered projects, and playing badminton.

										<p>My name is Irene McNelis, and I'm a senior at Monta Vista. I joined BAYCO as an Event Coordinator in 2017, and this year I am the Vice President of the group as well as a Foundation Board Representative. I joined this organization because I believe in our mission to provide opportunities for high school students to develop their skills in leadership and interpersonal skills. Many interested students are not given the opportunity to develop their leadership skills or other important mindsets that will assist them in college and in life, so I am glad to be a part of a team that works to provide these opportunities to students. Other than working on BAYCO, I enjoy playing competitive softball and recreational water polo, competing in business competitions, and gaming.</p>

Being a part of BAYCO for a majority of my high school career has helped me realize the importance of career development. Getting a job or a volunteer opportunity can help everyone gain valuable life skills. Our workshops and annual job fair can enable you with vital skills and provide you with amazing opportunities!  Other than interning at BAYCO, I love trying new foods and discovering new cultures. I love the environment and plan on saving the Earth someday. </p>
