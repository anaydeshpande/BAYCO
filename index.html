										<p>Hi, my name is Sreehari! I am a current sophomore at Cupertino High School and I love developing Android, iOS, and websites in my spare time! I joined BAYCO to help fellow high schoolers find internships and gain valuable work experience.

										<p>My name is Irene McNelis, and I'm a junior at Monta Vista. I joined BAYCO because I believed in their mission to provide workshops and internship opportunities to high school students. Many interested students are not given the opportunity to develop their leadership skills or other important mindsets that will assist them in college and in life, so I am glad to be a part of a team that works to provide these opportunities to students.</p>

										<p>I am Kuhu Mathur and I am a junior at Lynbrook. I am one of the three Event Coordinators here at BAYCO. Honestly, being a part of this organization has helped me realize the importance of starting your career off early. Us students get caught up in homework and other extracurriculars that we ignore how getting a job or a volunteer opportunity can actually boost your resume! Other than interning at BAYCO, I love trying new foods and eating in general. I love the environment and plan on saving the Earth someday. </p>

I serve as BAYCO's community and business liaison and work with the rest of the team as an intern at the FUHS Foundation. The Silicon Valley is home to lots of innovation and it's important that students are aware and connected to the various career and educational opportunities. In school, I’m involved in ASB, FBLA, and Mock Trial. I'm super excited to be working on new events, workshops, and opportunities for all of you year!</p>
